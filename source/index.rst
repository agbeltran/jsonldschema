Welcome to jsonldschema's documentation!
========================================

The JSONLDschema python package offers functionality to support the creation and use of machine-actionable and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) metadata models expressed as `JSON-schemas <https://json-schema.org/>`_ for `JSON-LD <http://json-ld.org/>`_ data.

The approach relies on representing the metadata models as JSON-schemas with additional JSON-LD context files to provide semantic annotations to the model.

This python package can be used in combination with some visualisation tools:

* the JSONschema-documenter: given a network of JSON-schemas (formed by a main schema that references other schemas), it visualises them on the web
   * the source code available on GitHub: https://github.com/FAIRsharing/JSONschema-documenter
   * the tool is hosted on GitHub and can be seen here: https://fairsharing.github.io/JSONschema-documenter/
* the JSONschema-compare-and-view tool:
   * the source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/FAIRsharing/JSONschema-compare-and-view
   * the tool is hosted on GitHub and can be seen here: https://fairsharing.github.io/JSONschema-compare-and-view/

We have used this approach in several metadata models, such as the `Data Tag Suite (DATS) <https://github.com/datatagsuite/README>`_ model for data discovery and `multiple metadata models <https://github.com/fairsharing/mircat>`_ generated from Minimum Information Requirements.
